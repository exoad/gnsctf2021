It is suggested that in the case you gain access to this repository that you shall not clone this repository.

The reason is that a lot of the stuffs here are not fixed and are not checked and can be "harmful" to your device and knowing that
none of the collaborators nor the owner will be held accountable for any mishaps, use code and this repository with caution.

***The other big reason is that this repository is just bloat, and you should not clone it in order to leave space for your own stuffs.
I would suggest just forking this repository!
